What you learnt outside the class?
Be specific...

Week1
As part of the assignment I learnt about a new programming language, Scala.It was the first time i heard of this name. On further reading 
i found scala as powerful language present at the back end of some major projects, which i have used but was never curious to find more.
Later with the second assignment,I started thinking what can be made with a new programming language in the given deadline. Balckjack was the
game I thought would be easy to simulate.
